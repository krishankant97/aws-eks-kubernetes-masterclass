1 - Pod - Smallest Object we can create

2 - Replica set - Gurantee the pods in the deployment 

3 - Deployment - Rollout and Rollback is features - for the stateless applicioan

4 - Service - It act as the load balancer that sit in front of the pod 

We can create the object using the Impretive and the declrative way 

means using the commands and using the yaml file to create the oobjects 

Pod - 

Our goal is to deploy the application in form of the container on the worker node 

Kuberenets not directly deploy the container directly 

Container is encaspulated inside the Kuberenetes object called the pod

Pod is single instance of the applicaion

generally we have 1 container per pod

If traffic grow we can scale applicaion in form of pod we need to scale the pod insted to scale the container insdie the pod 

We not have multiple container inside the 1 pod

Multi container Pod - 

In some case we have multi contianer inside the pod

They are not of same kind

like 1 container is Nginx 
2 is healper container - Sidecar contianer - data puller/pusher/proxy
They pull data from pod or push the data .
Proxy = like for putting the html/image to serve to the main container 

When we use multi contianer pod - 2 container easily connect each other as they share same network and also volume they can share easily
